# Introduction

The majority of vascular plant diversity in temperate woodlands existed
in the understory.

Need to ... biodiversity.

The UK's target of ... woodland creation

In in the 2021/2022 planting season 6970 hectares of broadleaved
woodland were created in the UK [@maxwell2022].

Legacy of woodland creation without management plans in place to ensure
...

Our understanding of how the composition of traits within a community of
organisms scales to constitute and influence ecosystem functioning
[@chacnabella2022] is a developing field, lacking ....

Woodland establishment for ecological restoration 

colonisation credit [@watts2020]

Where spatio-temporal barriers to migration exist, the self-assembly of
woodland understory communities cannot be relied upon, necessitating a
proactive approach must be taken in ecosystem restoration [@smith2017].

Such a stance, namely the promotion of translocation assisted colonisation to newly
planted woodlands with dispersal-limited understory flora is an
increasingly recognised management need in woodland creation schemes;
with the Woodland Trust making the need to *"Establish Richer
Communities"* explicit in their Woodland Creation Guide [@herbert2022].
Practically, organisations such as Eadha Enterprises now operate
woodland understory flora nurseries [@eadhaNursery] and offer ecological
site survey services for understory species translocation suitability
[@eadhaServices]. Centralised guidance has also recently been developed
in the form of the NatureScot Research Report *Establishing woodland
plants in broadleaved woods - interim best practice guidance for
conservation translocations* [@worrell2021]. Despite such advancements, there is 
still a distinct lack of UK-wide guidance.

# Aims

In response to this growing need for management advice the development of an 
R Shiny [@rcoreteam2022; @chang2022] web application is proposed. 
This application will act as a Decision Support Tool (DSS), 
aiding users in examining the suitability of woodland under-story
flora for translocation to a target woodland site.
The application will synthesise the analysis results with additional user inputs
to generate a report using a pro-forma which be developed based on the 
Scottish code for translocations project form [@naturescot2014].

A two-stage development strategy is proposed:

1.  A functional proof-of-concept tool.
    -   Using the current best available data.
    -   Developed as part of a scoping exercise by the author.
    -   No specific project funding.
2.  A comprehensive tool.
    -   Using data derived from additional analysis.
    -   Developed with a project team.
    -   Specific project funding (to be obtained).

The methodologies outlined in the Analysis Process section below correspond to 
development stage 1, with the additional analyses proposed for development stage
2 described in section A3 - Stage 2 Development.

It is hoped that the development stage 1 application will be opened to 
user-testing, with the view to collating feedback to inform development 
priorities for stage 2.

# Analysis Process

Following the ....

-   Decide whether a conservation translocation is appropriate
-   Increase the chance of success and wider potential benefits
-   Reduce the chance of failure and negative outcomes

The framework laid out in @worrell2021 will be adopted...

Taking inspiration from the restoration diagnostic framework described
in [@deVitis2022] the suitability of selected species for assisted
migration are assessed against the following criteria:

-   Colonisation Sources

    -   Are there areas of Ancient Woodland within colonisation
        distance?

    -   Are there areas of other woodland within colonisation distance?

    -   If surveyed, is the selected species present in woodlands within
        colonisation distance?

-   Genetic Factors

-   Biotic Factors

    -   B1 - Does the species require an animal vector for pollination?

-   Abiotic Factors \* Is the selected species suitable for the
    environmental niche on site?

-   Landscape Features

    -   Are there any physical barriers to colonisation?

-   Planning and Land Management Factors

    -   P6 - Is it likely that the selected species will be
        out-competed?

\newpage

@worrell2021 recommends that a four-step process be undertaken to
examine the necessity of woodland flora translocation, namely the
examination of:

1.  *Which species are already present in the target woodland?*
2.  *Which plant species are already present in adjacent woodland and
    habitats?*
3.  *Which species would naturally occur in the wood?*
4.  *Which species are missing from the woodland and nearby linked
    habitats?*

Following this guidance, we define four key criteria which determine
translocation suitability:

1.  Niche Suitability
2.  Community Suitability
3.  Migration Probability
4.  Distribution Suitability

## Niche Suitability

To examine whether a selected species is suitable for the sites specific
biogeoclimatic conditions, the multiMOVE plant species niche models
[@henrys2015paper; @henrys2015model; @smart2019] will be utilised in
conjunction with baseline (1961-1990) climate data along with future climate 
projections obtained from the CHESS-SCAPE dataset [@robinson2022] for the annual
average rainfall, minimum January temperature, and maximum July temperature.
The Forest Research ESC soil survey data will be used, with the 'Soil Wetness', 
'Substrate Fertility' MultiMOVE niche metrics mapped to the (Soil Nutrient 
Regime) and SMR (Soil Moisture Regime) values.

## Community Suitability

To assess whether the selected species is sociologically suited to the
community of flora present, or desired community at the selected woodland, 
two options will made available to the user:

1.  Selection of a target National Vegetation Classification (NVC) community.
2.  Assessment of the closest NVC woodland communities already present.

To facilitate option 2, an R implementation of the Modular Analysis of 
Vegetation Information System (MAVIS) will be utilised, requiring the user to 
enter NVC survey data for the target woodland.

The presence of the selected species will then be cross-referenced against the
closest fitted NVC communities to the survey data for phytosociological
suitability.

## Migration Probability

To determine the likelihood that the selected species will successfully migrate
from a nearby source (if present) to the target woodland, 
the maximum dispersal distance (MDD) will be
calculated by taking the product of the yearly MDD, and user-defined time period 
(measured in years). This distance will then be compared to the distance between
the target woodland, and source populations of the selected species obtained
through survey data entry and retrieval of species occurrence
data from the NBN Atlas [@nbnatlas2023] application programming interface (API). 

Estimations of the yearly MDD will obtained through a
literature review and estimation using the {dispeRsal} R package
[@tamme2014].

The user will then select the time period over which to examine
dispersal likelihood, with three options available:

1.  An estimate for the optimum successional age (in years) for the
    selected species, measured from the disturbance/establishment time
    of the target woodland derived from @chytr2021.
2.  The difference between the age of the target woodland, and an ecological
    restoration target age.
3.  A custom, user-stipulated value.

Barriers to migration such as roads, paths, rivers, trainlines, and urban areas
will be assessed as obstacles based on the path of migration and dispersal symdrome.
In the case 
See Figure 2 for a provisional representation of how the migration factors will 
be communicated to the user.

## Distribution Suitability

To determine whether the target woodland is within the distribution of
the selected species permission is currently being sought from the Botanical 
Society of Britain \& Ireland for use of their distribution data.

## Survey Data

The user will be able to use the tool without inputting any survey data, however 
the results will be insufficiently rigorous to inform translocation suitability,
being reliant on only a user-stipulated target community and NBN occurrence data.
For a rigorous assessment, the user will be required to input NVC survey data
for the target woodland, and species presence data for ancient woodlands, other
woodlands, scrub habitat, and hedgerows in the vicinity. 

## Selected Species

A limited subset of species will be included in stage 1 of the
application. This selection will be determined by the available data,
with species selected if they are: 
1) present in the NVC floristic tables for communities W1 - W18e; 
2) present in the MultiMOVE niche models; and
3) used as Ancient Woodland Indicators, as determined by @glaves2009survey. 
The application of these criteria results in the selection
of `r combined_df_selected_speciesCount` species. 
Only `r combined_df_selected_dispeRsalCount` of these species are represented in
the baseline {dispeRsal} data, necessitating estimation of the MDD by traits at 
the genus or family level, or manually through a literature review if
possible. See [Section A2 - Selected Species](#selected_species_table) for a 
list of proposed species.

```


## Analysis Results

Following assessment against the aforementioned four criteria, it is proposed 
that the selected species will be recommended for translocation or assisted
colonisation (or conservatively further investigation) if it is:

1.  Absent from the target woodland site.
2.  Present in the closest, or target community.
3.  Suitable to the sites local biogeoclimatic conditions, at a given
    stage of woodland development.
4.  Estimated to be unlikely to naturally migrate to the site within a
    reasonable time frame.
5.  Within the known distribution of the species.

## A3 - Stage 2 Development

### A3i - Niche Suitability

There are a number of potential developments for the niche suitability analysis.
Firstly, species absent in MultiMOVE but present in the NVC floristic tables
could be examined.
Secondly, using Forest Research soil survey data and derived datasets for 
SMR and SNR, the MultiMOVE niche models could be expanded to assess the 
'Soil Wetness' and 'Substrate Fertility' variables independently, rather than as 
a function of the community-weighted mean Hill-Ellenberg values.
Thirdly, a Bayesian approach could be taken to integrate species occurrence
and more comprehensive presence-absence survey data following @morera-pujol2022,
additionally further survey data could be added.
Fourthly, the 1km resolution climatic data used to identify the site conditions 
could be down-scaled using the {microclimc} R package [@maclean2021], to
account for the influence of woodland structure on microclimate.

### A3ii - Community Suitability

Further development of the community suitability analysis could include
examination of species absent from the NVC floristic tables and/or
inclusion of a community classification system other than the NVC, e.g. the UK 
Habitat Classification System.
  
### A3iii - Migration Probability

It is likely that the largest source of uncertainty in the analysis is the 
examination of the likelihood of migration. There are several avenues which 
could be explored to improve this methodology. 
Firstly, the probability of successful migration could be calculated using a 
probability density function such as the total dispersal kernel [@rogers2019].
Such functions could be estimated using empirical data [@bullock2016] 
where available. This approach is necessary for capturing the uncertainty
inherent in estimating dispersal distance, particulalry for zoochory-mediated
dispersal with fat-tailed probabili ........... and for correctly representing species
with sequential dispersal syndromes such as *Mercurialis perennis*, the seeds of 
which are first dispersed ballistically as estimated in @tamme2014, but are then
also dispersed by ants [@jefferson2008].

### A3iv - Distribution Suitability

Further development of the distribution suitability analysis could include....
